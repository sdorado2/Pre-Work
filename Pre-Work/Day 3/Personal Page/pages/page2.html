		In my free time, I would usually watch random videos in youtube. The algorithm would suggest videos some 'interesting' videos. Other times, I would watch football/soccer games. This November and December, I had the chance to watch most of the world cup games. After the world cup, I started playing a new game in my nintendo switch. I need to start tackling my backlog of games. &#128528
