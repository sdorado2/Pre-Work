		<p>This is going to be a long line of text to see how the paragraph tag is going to be displayed in a browser. Eventually, a CSS selector is going to be applied to make this paragraph more pleasent to the eyes. At the first attempt, it did not work. The reason it did not work, it is because there was no reference to the css sheet. After adding the reference link to css sheet, nothing happened. The text still looks as before. Maybe if I enclose the paragraph tag within a div tag it may work. I made the change from p tag to div tag, but saw no change. To see if there was any issue with the css sheet, a selector was used on the p tag. The selector did change the p tag's font size. after playing around with css sheet, I was able to find the answer. It turns out that ID and class selectors need to be located at a specific location. First, the html selectors need to listed. After that has been added to css sheet, the ID and class selector need to be added.
